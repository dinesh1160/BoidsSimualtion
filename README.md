# Boids Simulation Using C++ and SFML
Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds, and related group motion.
It follows 3 Simple rules:
  - separation
  - alignment
  - cohesion

## Dependencies:
- c++17 
- SFML 2.6+
- Make

## Run 
Run `make` to produce an executable file called boids_simulation.
```
make
```
Then run the simulation using
```
./boids_simulation
```

The boids movement values can be tweaked in the `constants.hpp` file

Press `Esc` to exit the Program.
